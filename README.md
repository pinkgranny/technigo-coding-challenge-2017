# Coding Challenge 2017

### Brief
This is your chance to make your personal mark on one of the most used web services out there today: GOOGLE. We want you to re-build the front, meaning how it looks like NOT any functionality. Style it however you like, go crazy bold or a do it more minimalistic - the important thing is that you have fun doing it! And hopefully learn something new in the process.

### Requirements
Your solution must contain:
* An image.
* A button.
* An input field.

### How to start
1. Sketch with pen and paper how you want your version of Google to look like. 
2. Structure your work. Break down your solution in smaller blocks. Estimate how long each block will take to build. Does it sound reasonable to finish? If yes, move on to the next step. If not, go back to step 1 and revise your scope.
3. Download or clone this repository with templates and start coding.

### Delivery
Create a solution for our Coding Challenge here on Github. Upload all files on your Github page. The repository should be public, not private so we can read it. Submit a link to it in your application form. It’s important that you have it ready before submitting your application.

Send us a link to your public Github repository containing your solution in your application form. 

### Why do I need to apply with a coding challenge?
We know that all of you are beginners at programming - we will not judge your solution based on the quality of your code or amount of work. We do however want to see that you’ve touched on a bit of programming before and know what you’re getting yourself into.

Make sure to have fun during the process! Do something that you find interesting and motivating.

**GOOD LUCK!**
